## Course description

The vast influx of telecommunications infrastructure has coincided with a massive centralization of wealth and power. How has this barrage of spectacles on screens brokered global inequality? What was the utopian goal of early tech-creators, and were those values embodied in the design of the tools we use today? 

With contemporary society and our collective future irrevocably changed by ubiquitous technology, the questions that makers, artists and technologists pose to society are increasingly relevant. 

This class at SFPC will provide a critical discussion on some of the most relevant aspects of technological society today. We'll draw from theorists such as Jean Baudrillard, Jodi Dean and Alexander Galloway, and science fiction writers such as Bruce Sterling and Ursula K Le Guin. 

## Expectations and Structure

* Each week, two people from the class will present that week's readings. 
* Read all the material and come prepared to discuss it in depth. Please bring other resources, authors and artists that you find relevant.
* As this is primarily a discussion-based class, let's have all laptops closed. See [Clay Shirky's post on Medium](https://medium.com/@cshirky/why-i-just-asked-my-students-to-put-their-laptops-away-7f5f7c50f368) about how this is better for everyone.
* Brainstorm and create a final class project.
* Blog weekly about the readings and your thoughts.
