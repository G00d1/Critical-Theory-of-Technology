# Critical Theory of Technology

* **Course:** Politics, Utopia and Code, Fall 2014
* **Location:** [School for Poetic Computation](http://sfpc.io/) | [@sfpc_school](https://twitter.com/sfpc_school) | [Orbital Labs, 4th Floor](http://orbitalnyc.com/)
* **When:** Fridays at 1pm
* **Instructor:** [Allison Burtch](http://allisonburtch.net), [allison@sfpc.io](mailto:allison@sfpc.io)

## Course description

The vast influx of telecommunications infrastructure has coincided with a massive centralization of wealth and power. How has this barrage of spectacles on screens brokered global inequality? What was the utopian goal of early tech-creators, and were those values embodied in the design of the tools we use today? 

With contemporary society and our collective future irrevocably changed by ubiquitous technology, the questions that makers, artists and technologists pose to society are increasingly relevant. 

This class at SFPC will provide a critical discussion on some of the most relevant aspects of technological society today. We'll draw from theorists such as Jean Baudrillard, Jodi Dean and Alexander Galloway, and science fiction writers such as Bruce Sterling and Ursula K Le Guin. 

## Expectations and Structure

* Each week, two people from the class will present that week's readings. 
* Read all the material and come prepared to discuss it in depth. Please bring other resources, authors and artists that you find relevant.
* As this is primarily a discussion-based class, let's have all laptops closed. See [Clay Shirky's post on Medium](https://medium.com/@cshirky/why-i-just-asked-my-students-to-put-their-laptops-away-7f5f7c50f368) about how this is better for everyone.
* Brainstorm and create a final class project.
* Blog weekly about the readings and your thoughts.

#Schedule

## Week 1
* Friday, October 10th, 1pm
* In Class
What is critical theory? How can this be applied to technology? In class we'll watch [All Watched Over by Machines of Love and Grace](https://vimeo.com/38724174) and discuss the goals for the class.
* Readings 
	* _Mindstorms_ by Seymour Papert
		- "In the chapters that follow I shall try to give you some idea of these possibilities, many of which are dependent on a computer-rich future, a future where a computer will be a significant part of every child's life. But I want my readers to be very clear that what is "utopian" in my vision and in this book is a particular way of using computers, of forging new relationships between computers and people -- that the computer will be there to be used is simply a conservative premise"
	* Alan Kay - ["Face to Face: Alan Kay Still Waiting for the Revolution"](http://www.scholastic.com/browse/article.jsp?id=5)
	* Steve Jobs - ["Bicycles for the mind"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ob_GX50Za6c)
