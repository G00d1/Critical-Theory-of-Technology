#Weeks 8 - 10 
We'll discuss the content and structure of the final weeks soon. Perhaps there is an area of study that SFPC students wish to explore, perhaps this is spent preparing and discussing our final project together.

## Expectations and Structure

* Read all the material and come prepared to discuss it in depth. Please bring other resources, authors and artists that you find relevant.
* Each week, two people from the class will present that week's readings. 
* As this is primarily a discussion-based class, let's have all laptops closed. See Clay Shirkey's post on how this is actually better for everyone.
* Help create a final class project.
* Blog weekly about the readings and your thoughts.
